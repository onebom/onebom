hi👋 I'm interested in machine learning, computer vision, and 3D generative model.   
my primary research goal aims to the development of generalizable deeplearning models to challenging yet practical scenarios

### Currently Learning
- DL for Computer vision(and API like tensorflow, pytorch)
- Generative Models and Neural Radiance Fields
- Computer Graphics
- Linear Algebra & Probability for Deep Learning

### Research Portfolio
- [DNA 2022]()   
  Automatic injection controller Web Service with YoloV4 fluid detection.   
  + 2022 창의혁신 DNA 산학협력 연구 프로젝트 공학혁신상 수상
- [Deep Learning based Malocclusion classification with distance of molar relationships 2021]()   
  Classification malocclusion using pseudo multi-label   
  + 2021 춘계 대한의용생체공학회 초록 게재 및 특허 출원
- [Attention 3rd Molar to canal using CBAM 2021]()   
  three-step learning pipeline to classify 3rd Molar and lower tubular nerve contact

### Project Activities
- [GenerativeAI]() - private library for generative model including GAN, style-trasfer and Controllable Generation (Pytorch)
- [NowMeSeeMe]() - Application for emotional monitoring and psychological counseling using avatar (Tensorflow, Unity)
- [RoomFit]() - Real-time home cam yoga posture correction web service using Mediapipe's BlazePose model (Vue, Flask, nodeJS)

### Vitæ
- Krafton Jungle (2022.10~2023.3)
- MMMIL, Resarch scientist (2021.2~2022.5)
